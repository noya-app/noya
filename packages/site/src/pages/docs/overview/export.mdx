## Exporting to design files or code

Noya offers the ability to export the high-fidelity output to design files or
code. When you are ready to hand off or implement your design, exporting is the
next step. To export, click the Export button in the top right corner of the
screen and select the desired file format. In a few seconds, a file will start
downloading.

The file formats available to export are:

- PNG, a raster graphics format
- PDF or SVG, vector graphics formats
- React code

Each file format is suited for specific purposes. The following sections
describe common cases for exporting along with a recommendation for which file
format to choose in each case.

> Exporting is a beta feature and we recommend testing it early and throughout
> your design process to make sure you can get the output you need. Please
> [reach out](https://noyasoftware.notion.site/Noya-Contact-9a95e0895eba4f578517dfdc4d94ccdd)
> if you run into any issues with export.

## Sharing a screenshot or mockup of the design

Exporting a PNG file creates an image file is suitable for sharing. For example,
you can email it or upload it on any platform that supports image attachments
(such as Slack, Discord, or Linear). The file contains pixel data, meaning that
if it were to be opened in a design tool, it would appear as one big image,
similar to a screenshot. This means that the file would appear the same no
matter where it's viewed, but it's not very editable.

> If you want a quick way to let someone view your design while you are working
> on it, we recommend using the [Sharing](sharing) option, which creates a link
> to preview your Noya project. This is easier to share than uploading an image
> file and it allows the viewer to refresh the file as you make edits.

## Handing off the design to work on it in Figma or Sketch

If you need to fine tune the design or slice it into multiple asset files, you
can export to Figma or Sketch and then work with the design in those apps. Noya
provides specific export file formats for Figma (based on SVG) and Sketch (based
on PDF). Files exported with these options can be dragged and dropped directly
into your canvas in Figma or Sketch. These exports contain layer data, so you
will be able to manipulate and edit each layer.

## Handing off the design to implement with React code

If you are building a React app, the React code exported from Noya can be used
as a reference for how to configure the components from the selected design
system's component library to look exactly like your design, or in some cases,
the code can be inserted directly into your app.

Exporting to React code provides you with a ZIP file containing two files:

- App.tsx: This file contains the view, which will be your design built using
  the component library for your selected design system.
- package.json: This file describes the dependencies required for the code to
  run. Typically, this is the component library for your selected design system
  and supporting packages related to styling and additional assets such as
  icons.

> Noya currently does not handle advanced layout features, such as responsive
> layouts. So while your generated React code should look identical to the
> high-fidelity design you see in Noya, keep in mind that many of the components
> will be positioned with absolute coordinates, so you will likely need to make
> changes to use the code in a production layout.
