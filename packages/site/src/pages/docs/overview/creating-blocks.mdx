## Using the Insert Tool

To create a block, first activate the Insert tool
<InlineIcon name="PlusIcon" />. You can do this by clicking the Insert tool
button at the top left of the toolbar, or by holding the `Command ⌘` key (on
Mac) or `Control` key (on Windows).

Once the Insert tool is active, you can click and drag to create a block. The
block will be created at the size of the rectangle you drew.

## Block inference

When you create a block, Noya will try to infer an appropriate block type based
on a variety of factors, including its size and position. If the block Noya
chooses is not the one you want, there are two ways to change it:

- You can change block type via the dropdown menu next to the block's name.
- You can double click to edit the block's contents, and then type `/` followed
  by the name of the block type you want.

## Configuring block content

To edit the contents of a block, double click it or press `Enter`. In general,
you can type text and it will influence how the block is rendered.

<img src={ConfigureBlockText.src} alt="Configure block text" />

Some blocks have multiple nested blocks within that can be edited individually.
Some blocks (e.g. [Image](/docs/blocks/elements/image),
[Icon](/docs/blocks/elements/icon), [Write](/docs/blocks/elements/write))
require special text. To understand how to edit a particular block, check the
documentation page for that block in the [Block Reference](/app/docs/blocks)
section.

You can click anywhere outside of the block or press `Escape` to exit edit mode.
