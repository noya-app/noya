## Showing others your design

Noya provides a simple way to let anyone preview your project with a link. Click
on the Share button in the top right corner of your project and toggle the
"Share (read only)" option to its "on" position. This will generate a share
link, which you can copy and share. Anyone with this share link can see the same
high-fidelity output view that you see, but they cannot edit your project.

You can toggle this feature on or off at any time. There is no need for the
viewer to have a Noya account.

The share link will stay up to date with any changes you make in your project.
If someone is using the share link while you are making edits, they can refresh
the page to view the latest changes.

## Collaborating with others

Currently, Noya projects can only be edited by the creator of the project. The
best way to collaborate is to allow others to clone your project, which means
making their own editable copy of your project. They can then make changes in
their copy of the project. You can repeat the process, cloning the project back
and forth to share drafts with each other.

To allow someone to clone your project, start by sharing your project and then
toggle the "This is a template" option to its "on" position. This permission
allows anyone with your share link to clone your project.

You can toggle this feature on or off at any time. The person you are
collaborating with will need to have a Noya account in order to clone your
project and edit it. They will be prompted to sign in or sign up when they clone
your project.
