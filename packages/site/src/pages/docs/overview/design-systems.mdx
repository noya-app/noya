## Choosing a base design system

Noya currently supports two design systems:

- [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) (default)
- [Material Design](https://mui.com/)

We plan to add first-class support for more open source design systems in the
future, including [Ant Design](https://ant.design/).

## Importing your company's design system

Importing a custom design system isn't supported yet. If you're interested in
being an early adopter of this feature, please
