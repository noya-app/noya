import { radioSymbolId } from '../../../../ayon/symbols/symbolIds';

## Live Preview

You can double click the block to edit its contents.

<InteractiveBlockPreview symbolId={radioSymbolId} />

## Configuration

You can configure the radio with text, which will appear as a label to the
right. The radio has a few different states that can be configured by adding:

- `#off` - to deselect the radio (default)
- `#on` - to select the radio
- `#disabled` - to disable the radio
- `#no-label` - to hide the label

Here's an example with a text label, `#on` and `#disabled`:

<InteractiveBlockPreview
  symbolId={radioSymbolId}
  blockText="Only on Fridays #on #disabled"
/>
