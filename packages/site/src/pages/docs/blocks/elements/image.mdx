## Configuration

By default, the image block searches https://unsplash.com for images based on
the text within the block. For example, the default text is `landscape`, so the
block picks a nice landscape image.

You can click the <InlineIcon name="ReloadIcon" /> icon in the block's toolbar
to search for a different image using the same search text, e.g. `landscape`.
