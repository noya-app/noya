import { checkboxSymbolId } from '../../../../ayon/symbols/symbolIds';

## Live Preview

You can double click the block to edit its contents.

<InteractiveBlockPreview symbolId={checkboxSymbolId} />

## Configuration

You can configure the checkbox with text, which will appear as a label to the
right. The checkbox has a few different states that can be configured by adding:

- `#off` - to uncheck the checkbox (default)
- `#on` - to check the checkbox
- `#disabled` - to disable the checkbox
- `#no-label` - to hide the label

Here's an example with a text label, `#on` and `#disabled`:

<InteractiveBlockPreview
  symbolId={checkboxSymbolId}
  blockText="Enable daily notifications #on #disabled"
/>
