import {
  heading1SymbolId,
  heading3SymbolId,
} from '../../../../ayon/blocks/symbolIds';

## Live Preview

You can double click the block to edit its contents.

<InteractiveBlockPreview blockId={heading1SymbolId} />

## Configuration

There are 6 different pre-defined heading styles, each represented by a
different block type. The block types are:

- `Heading 1`
- `Heading 2`
- `Heading 3`
- `Heading 4`
- `Heading 5`
- `Heading 6`

The heading block accepts many `#` commands for styling text. For example,
here's a `Heading 3` block with the styles `#text-red-600 #center`:

<InteractiveBlockPreview
  blockId={heading3SymbolId}
  blockText="All About Cats #text-red-600 #center"
/>

## Limitations

There is currently no way to change the font size or font family.
