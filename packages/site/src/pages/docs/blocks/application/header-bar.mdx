## Live Preview

You can double click the block to edit its contents.

<InteractiveBlockPreview symbolId={headerBarSymbolId} />

## Configuration

Items in the header bar should be comma separated. To show a specific item as
active, type `*` before the item name.

You can further configure the header bar's style by adding:

- `#title` - to use the first item as a title
- `#dark` - to use the dark theme
- `#accent` - to use the accent color variant of the theme
- `#search` - to include a search bar

Here's an example configuration that uses these options (double click to edit):

<InteractiveBlockPreview
  symbolId={headerBarSymbolId}
  blockText={`Wayfinder, Locations, *Points of Interest, Map #title #dark #accent #search`}
/>
