import { sidebarSymbolId } from '../../../../ayon/blocks/symbolIds';

## Live Preview

You can double click the block to edit its contents.

<InteractiveBlockPreview blockId={sidebarSymbolId} />

## Configuration

Each item in the sidebar should be on a separate line. To show a specific item
as active, type `*` before the item name.

You can further configure the sidebar's style by adding:

- `#title` - to use the first item as a title
- `#dark` - to use the dark theme

Here's an example configuration that uses these options (double click to edit):

<InteractiveBlockPreview
  blockId={sidebarSymbolId}
  blockText={`Dashboard
*Updates
Billing
#dark #title`}
  blockHeight={200}
/>
